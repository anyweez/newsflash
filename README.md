# Newsflash
Newsflash in an application that presents news geographically as a heatmap of the world. The frontend presents an interactive
map that can be used to browse events happening in a particular country, and also makes it easy to see what countries co-occur
in the news together.

## Status
I'm working on a full rewrite of a very out-of-date system that existed before. Currently that frontend is in reasonable shape
but work on the backend hasn't started yet. Stay tuned!

For now both the frontend and backend are contained in the same repository.
